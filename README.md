# Gradient Descent Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Logistic Regression model using Gradient Descent to predict the presence of lung cancer based on features like age and years of smoking experience. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras in Python.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of lung cancer occurrence based on a dataset that includes features such as age and years of smoking experience. A Logistic Regression model is trained using Gradient Descent, and predictions are made based on standardized input features.


## Datasets

| Age | Smoking_Years | Lung_Cancer |
| --- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 50  | 30            | 1           |
| 45  | 20            | 0           |



## Prerequisites
